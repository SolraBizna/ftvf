# ftvf

`ftvf` is a crate for carrying out game logic the One True Way: Fixed
Tickrate, Variable Framerate. By having your game logic in strictly
fungible ticks, rather than having it vary based on framerate, you gain
many advantages:

- **Repeatability**: the same inputs will have the same outputs, period.
- **Framerate independence**: no issues like Quake had where your exact
jump height depends on how fast your computer is.
- **Satisfaction**: knowing that you made the morally correct choice. :)

Bonus: If you know your refresh rate, `ftvf` can help you render frames at
exactly that rate, jitter-free.

To get started, add `ftvf` to your dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
ftvf = "0.6"
```

then initialize yourself a [`Metronome`](struct.Metronome.html):

```rust
let mut metronome = Metronome::new(
  RealtimeNowSource::new(),
  // want 30 ticks per 1 second
  Rate::per_second(30, 1),
  // accept being up to 5 ticks behind
  5,
);
```

And then your game loop looks like this:

```rust
while !world.should_quit() {
  world.handle_input();
  for reading in metronome.sample(Mode::UnlimitedFrames) {
    match reading {
      Reading::Tick => world.perform_tick(),
      Reading::Frame{phase} => world.render(phase),
      Reading::TimeWentBackwards
        => eprintln!("Warning: time flowed backwards!"),
      Reading::TicksLost
        => eprintln!("Warning: we're too slow, lost some ticks!"),
      // Mode::UnlimitedFrames never returns Idle, but other modes can, and
      // this is one way to handle it.
      Reading::Idle{duration} => std::thread::sleep(duration),
    }
  }
}
```

Your logic ticks operate in discrete, fixed time intervals. Then, when it
comes time to render, you render a frame which represents time some portion
of the way between two ticks, represented by its `phase`. Your rendering
process should render an interpolated state between the previous tick and
the current tick, based on the value of `phase`. Simple example:

```rust
self.render_at(self.previous_position
               + (self.current_position - self.previous_position) * phase);
```

## Changes

### Since 0.5.0

- `ftvf` no longer depends on `std`. You can use the `no_std` feature flag
  to make the `std` dependency go away, at the cost of not being able to
  use the built-in `RealtimeNowSource`.
- `Mode::MaxOneFramePerTick` has been renamed to `Mode::OneFramePerTick`.
- `metronome.sample()` now returns an iterator directly, instead of making
  you repeatedly call `metronome.status()` in a disciplined way.
- Rates are now passed using the new `Rate` structure, instead of as
  tuples.
- Timing is now perfectly accurate, instead of "only" having nanosecond
  precision. (Nanosecond precision is still used for frame phase
  calculation, and changing tick-/framerates at runtime also discards
  sub-nanosecond components.)
- `Status` has been renamed to `Reading`.
- `Reading::Idle` now directly gives you the wait time as a `Duration`,
  instead of making you go indirectly through the `metronome`.
- `Mode::TargetFramesPerSecond` added.
- Tickrate can now be changed at any time, with no temporal anomalyâ€”apart
  from up to one nanosecond of one-time temporal error per change.
- `NowSource::sleep` removed.
- `NowSource` no longer implies `Copy`.
- There is now a blanket `NowSource` implementation for all
  `Deref<Target=RefCell<NowSource>>` types, including `&RefCell<NowSource>`
  and `Box<RefCell<NowSource>>`. This makes fake `NowSources` a little more
  ergonomic.
- There is now a `FakeNowSource`, available with or without `no_std`, which
  you can use in any situation where real time is not a factor, such as
  unit tests or rendering replays to disk.
